* The order of suits from high to low is Spades, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds.

* There are always four players in a game.

* Each player holds 13 (randomly assigned) cards at the beginning of the game.

* The player holding the Three of Diamonds will begin the game by playing a hand of
  legal combination of cards that includes the Three of Diamonds. He/she cannot pass
  his/her turn to the next player without making his/her move.
  
* Players take turns to play by either playing a hand of legal combination of cards that
  beats the last hand of cards played on the table, or by passing his/her turn to the next
  player.
  
* A player cannot pass his/her turn to the next player if he/she is the one who played the
  last hand of cards on the table. In this case, he/she can play a hand of any legal
  combination of cards regardless of the last hand he/she played on the table.
  
* A hand of legal combination of cards can only be beaten by another better hand of
  legal combination of cards with the same number of cards.
  
* The game ends when any of the players has no more cards in his/her hand.
